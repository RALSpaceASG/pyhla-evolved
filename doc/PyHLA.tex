\section{Introduction}

The \module{PyHLA} module provides Python wrapper for the C++ HLA API, and
\method{pack}/\method{unpack} methods for IEEE 1516.2 data types.

The M\&S HLA is a general purpose architecture for distributed computer
simulation systems. It's defined in [HLA1.3] and [IEEE 1516.1].

\subsection{Motivation}

The \module{PyHLA} module aims to enable rapid development of HLA federates,
i.e. to simplify the activity 4.3 of FEDEP [IEEE 1516.3].

The HLA standard defines C++ mappings [IEEE 1516.1], but a significant
development effort is necessary to develop a HLA compliant federate in C++.
The development effort can be reduced by using
\begin{enumerate}
\item higher level interfaces, e.g. the Protocol Independent Interface in M\"{A}K VR-Link
\item code generators, e.g. the GENESIS developed by ONERA [GENESIS]
\end{enumerate}

The HLA standard does not cover all aspects.
The C++ API for value encoding [IEEE 1516.2] is not standardized. Every HLA
developer needs to implement the value encoding functions.

Integrating HLA into the Python language may reduce the development and
maintenance effort (compared to C/C++).

The Python language provides several benefits
\begin{enumerate}
\item Dynamic data types. High-level programming language.
\item Interpreted. Easy modifications.
\item Powerful plug-in system.
\item Many plug-ins providing scientific calculations, or geodetic conversions.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Build Instructions}

The \module{PyHLA} module requires
\begin{itemize}
\item Classic Python interpreter (\ulink{CPython}{http://www.python.org/download})
\item HLA1.3 RTI with C++ API (\ulink{CERTI}{http://www.cert.fr/CERTI}, \ulink{M\"{A}K RTI}{http://www.mak.com/products/rti.php})
\end{itemize}

The \module{PyHLA} source codes can be obtained from the \ulink{CERTI}{https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/certi}
applications repository.
\begin{verbatim}
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sv.gnu.org:/sources/certi co applications/PyHLA
\end{verbatim}

The source codes can be compiled and installed using
\begin{verbatim}
cmake . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local
make install
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Performance}

Discuss the performance penalty. Use the DFSS/DMAIC methodology.

Design experiments for performance measurements.

Measure performance of Python and plain C++ federates. Use multiple RTI: CERTI and MÃ„K RTI.

Discuss the results.

\section{High-Level API (NOT IMPLEMENTED)}
High-level interace. Shall encompass the most frequently used HLA features. May not encompass all of the features.

Do not hide the main loop from the user. Keep the tick() function in the Python script.

Automatic entity publication and discovery.

Example:
Connect to the RTIG.

connection = hla.Connection("federation", "federate", "model.fed")

Publish the aircraft.

\begin{verbatim}
connection.publishedEntities["OS-001"] = aircraft
\end{verbatim}

List world coordinates of all discovered aircrafts. By default, all discovered
entities are automatically stored in the discoveredEntities dictionary.

\begin{verbatim}
for entity in connection.discoveredEntities:
  if type(entity) == hla.Aircraft:
    print entity.WorldLocation
\end{verbatim}

Dynamic data types. Duck-typed.
Notifications received as method calls in sub-classed functions.

Example:
Define a custom Aircraft class.

\begin{verbatim}
class MyAircraft(Aircraft):
  pass
\end{verbatim}

Define a custom connection that will discover aircrafts only. Each aircraft will
be represented by the custom Aircraft class.

\begin{verbatim}
class MyConnection(Connection):
  def discoverObjectInstance(self, name, class):
    if class == hla.Aircraft:
      self.discoveredEntities[name] = MyAircraft()
\end{verbatim}
